## About this Devlog

This is where you should describe to your users what your devlog is about.
Refer to the corresponding section in the home page to learn more about devlogs.

For example this is how the Zine devlog describes itself:

> This is a non-exhaustive, curated list of changes meant to help users quickly see what has improved since they last checked.
>
> You can [subscribe to this page via RSS]($link.page('devlog').alternative('rss')).
>
> This page lists entries for the current year, for past entries consult the
[devlog archive](/devlog/).

Feel free to tweak it to your specific use case or replace it entirely as you
see fit.

Regardless of what you decide, you might want to make sure you preserve the
links to the RSS feed and to the devlog archive from the copy above.
