This page lists all the devlog years that are present on this site.
Note how the top navigation menu doesn't link to this page, but instead links
to the latest devlog year directly.

The reason for adopting this structure is to make sure that links that exist in
the wild to entries to our devlog don't become invalidated when a new year comes
around and we rotate the devlog feed.

Devlog rotation ensures that you don't have a single page that grows
indefinitely, eventually compromising your editing expreience and worsening your
user's browsing experience. You can use any arbitrary policy (even deleting old
entries if you are fine with having a more ephemeral devlog), but cutting them
by year is a good default option. 

When rotating a devlog all you have to do is create a new page with a newer
date set in the frontmatter `date` field, and update the page description to let
people know that this page is not the current year's devlog anymore.

The latest devlog year is also available [via RSS feed]($link.alternative('rss')).
